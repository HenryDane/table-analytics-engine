# table-analytics-engine

An engine designed for analysis of specifically-formatted databases. Currently works with Mann-Kendal test, Theil-Sen test, linear regression, mean, standard deviation, coefficcient of variance, and more. 

Supports a partial yet incomplete scripting engine.

Depends on:\
`wavelet2d` for wavelet math\
`gnuplot` for plotting\
`fftw` for fourier transforms\
`gnuplot-iostream` for c++ binding
